# INTRODUCTION 
Our mission is to harness the power of technology to confront the pressing challenges faced by undertrial prisoners in India. Our comprehensive solution comprises a mobile app offering legal aid, a platform connecting prisoners with pro bono lawyers, a rehabilitation program, a real-time monitoring dashboard, and a virtual platform for awareness of rights. 
By delivering a functional prototype, a robust business plan, and an impactful pitch deck, we aim to amplify the access to justice for undertrial prisoners, enhance their rehabilitation prospects, boost transparency in the criminal justice system, and foster collaboration between legal and tech experts for a more equitable society. 
Together, we can forge a brighter future for the underprivileged and underserved in our criminal justice system.

# EXISTING SYSTEM 
India's system for undertrial prisoners is fragmented, overcrowded, and under-resourced. With no unified law governing their treatment, conditions vary widely between states. Overcrowding leads to poor living conditions and a lack of basic necessities. Moreover, transparency and accountability are lacking, making it difficult to ensure fair treatment.
