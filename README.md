# PAROLE-REVOLUTIONIZING-THE-INDIAN-PRISION-SYSTEM
A software solution for undertrial prisoners in India, offering legal aid via a mobile app, connecting them with pro bono lawyers, and facilitating rehabilitation, aiming for improved justice outcomes. It features modules for Prisoners, Advocates, and Courts, ensuring transparency and collaboration for social justice.

# INTRODUCTION 
Our mission is to harness the power of technology to confront the pressing challenges faced by undertrial prisoners in India. Our comprehensive solution comprises a mobile app offering legal aid, a platform connecting prisoners with pro bono lawyers, a rehabilitation program, a real-time monitoring dashboard, and a virtual platform for awareness of rights. 
By delivering a functional prototype, a robust business plan, and an impactful pitch deck, we aim to amplify the access to justice for undertrial prisoners, enhance their rehabilitation prospects, boost transparency in the criminal justice system, and foster collaboration between legal and tech experts for a more equitable society. 
Together, we can forge a brighter future for the underprivileged and underserved in our criminal justice system.

# EXISTING SYSTEM 
India's system for undertrial prisoners is fragmented, overcrowded, and under-resourced. With no unified law governing their treatment, conditions vary widely between states. Overcrowding leads to poor living conditions and a lack of basic necessities. Moreover, transparency and accountability are lacking, making it difficult to ensure fair treatment.

# DE-MERITS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM

**1.Lack of access to legal aid:** Undertrial prisoners often do not have access to legal aid, which means that they cannot afford to hire a lawyer to represent them in court. This can make it difficult for them to get bail or to defend themselves against the charges against them.<br>
**2.Case Delays:** Manual and paper-based processes can lead to delays in case processing, court hearings, and the resolution of legal matters, which can result in prolonged pretrial detention periods.<br>
**3.Lack of transparency and accountability:** There is no way to track the status of undertrial prisoners or to ensure that they are treated fairly. This can lead to abuse and neglect.<br>
**4.Lack of rehabilitation programs:** Undertrial prisoners often do not have access to rehabilitation programs. These programs can help them to learn new skills, get their GED, and prepare for reintegration into society after their release.<br>
